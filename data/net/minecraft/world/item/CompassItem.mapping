	METHOD isFoil (Lnet/minecraft/world/item/ItemStack;)Z
		COMMENT Returns {@code true} if this item has an enchantment glint. By default, this returns <code>stack.isItemEnchanted()</code>, but other items can override it (for instance, written books always return true).
		COMMENT
		COMMENT Note that if you override this method, you generally want to also call the super version (on {@link Item}) to get the glint for enchanted items. Of course, that is unnecessary if the overwritten version always returns true.
		ARG 1 stack
	METHOD useOn (Lnet/minecraft/world/item/context/UseOnContext;)Lnet/minecraft/world/InteractionResult;
		COMMENT Called when this item is used when targeting a Block
		ARG 1 context
